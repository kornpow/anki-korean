Korean-English Image Processing Overview
========================================

TASK: Parse Korean and English text from 1,353 images in cropped_boxes/ directory and create a CSV file.

APPROACH:
1. Each image contains Korean text (larger, black) and English translation (smaller, gray)
2. Using developer__image_processor tool to visually analyze each image
3. Manually extracting text pairs from each processed image
4. Appending results to korean_english_pairs.csv using shell echo commands

PROGRESS:
- Total images: 1,353
- Processed so far: ~13 images
- Method: Sequential processing, one image at a time
- Output format: filename,korean_text,english_text

CHALLENGES:
- Large volume of images requires manual processing
- Some images may be missing (getting file not found errors)
- Process is time-intensive but accurate since no OCR is used

CURRENT STATUS:
- CSV file created with proper headers
- Successfully processing images in sequence
- Using append mode to avoid context size issues
- Duplicates are being preserved as requested

NEXT STEPS:
- Continue processing remaining ~1,340 images
- Verify final CSV completeness
- Handle any missing files encountered

FILES CREATED:
- korean_english_pairs.csv (main output)
- batch_processor.py (helper script)
- remaining_files.txt (list of unprocessed files)
- overview.txt (this file)
